# 👋 Hi!

I work with product companies to develop user centric strategies, and I craft stories to inspire teams and attract customers. 
I design teams and operational practices to create high-functioning organizations, but I also love to get into the details and get stuff done.

I am currently in the process of moving my family to Munich in Germany. Before that I spent the last 10 years in Budapest, Hungary. During that time I worked with the team at [Shapr3D](https://www.shapr3d.com) to build better CAD software, and the team at [Prezi](https://www.prezi.com) to create more engaging presentations. I am originally from Malta in the Mediterranean, where I spent 5 years working on software utilities and marketing infrastructure with a now defunct company called Uniblue. 

If you think I can help you or your company, feel free to reach out.

## 🏡 Personal

When I'm not working, I spend all my time with my family of 5 (👨‍🦲👩👧👧🐶), or doing my best to take care of myself and maintain a great quality of life (🏃🧘🏋️📖🚶🍳).
