# 👋 Hi!

I work with product companies to develop user centric strategies, and I craft stories to inspire teams and attract customers. 
I design teams and operational practices to create high-functioning organizations, but I also love to get into the details and get stuff done.

Right now I am taking some time off from full time employment, while exploring some ideas, advising, and doing some investing. Before that I spent 5 years working with the team at [Shapr3D](https://www.shapr3d.com) to build better CAD software, and a total of almost 15 years building software products.

If you think I can help you or your company, feel free to reach out.

## 🏡 Personal

When I'm not working, I spend all my time with my family of 5 (👨‍🦲👩👧👧🐶), or doing my best to take care of myself and maintain a great quality of life (🏃🧘🏋️📖🚶🍳).
