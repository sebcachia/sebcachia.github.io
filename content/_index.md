# 👋 Hi!

I work with product companies to develop researched back strategies, craft stories to inspire teams and attract customers. 
I design teams and operational practices to create high-functioning organizations, but I also love to get into the details and get stuff done.

Most recently, I spent 5 years working with the team at [Shapr3D](https://www.shapr3d.com) to build better CAD software.

Sometimes, I advise early stage startups or do some Product coaching, reach out if you think I can help you.

## 🏡 Personal

When I'm not working, I spend all my time with my family of 5 (👨‍🦲👩👧👧🐶), or doing my best to take care of myself and maintain a great quality of life (🏃🧘🏋️📖🚶🍳).
