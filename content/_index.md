# 👋 Hi!

My name is Sebastian, you can call me Seb.

I work with product companies to develop researched back strategies, craft stories to inspire teams and attract customers. I design teams and operational practices to create high-functioning organizations, and I also love to get into the details and get stuff done.

I have been working in Product Management for over 14 years. Most recently, I spent 5 years working with the team at [Shapr3D](https://www.shapr3d.com) to build better CAD software.

Sometimes, I find the time to advise early stage startups or do some Product coaching, reach out if you think I can help you.

When I am not working, I spend all my time with my family of 5 (👨‍🦲👩👧👧🐶), or doing my best to take care of myself and maintain a great quality of life (🏃🧘🏋️📖🧘‍♂️🚶🚲🍳).
