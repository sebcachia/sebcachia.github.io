# 👋 Hi!

I work with product companies to develop user centric strategies, and I craft stories to inspire teams and attract customers. 
I design teams and operational practices to create high-functioning organizations, but I also love to get into the details and get stuff done.

I have spent the last 15 years working on digital products. I currently work with [Personio](https://personio.com) creating software for HR teams to build better companies. Before that I was early at [Shapr3D](https://www.shapr3d.com) where we built better 3D tools for product manufacturing companies, and I also spent time at [Prezi](https://www.prezi.com) working on software to create more engaging presentations. I also do some advising and mentoring, and I sometimes angel invest through [BADIdeas.fund](https://badideas.fund/). If you think I can help you or your company, feel free to reach out.

## 🏡 Personal

When I'm not working, I spend all my time with my family of 5 (👨‍🦲👩👧👧🐶), or doing my best to take care of myself and maintain a great quality of life (🏃🧘🏋️📖🚶🍳).

My family and I are currently based in Munich, Germany. We are originally from Malta in the Mediterranean, and we spent 10 years living in Budapest, Hungary.
