## Education

### [University of London](https://www.london.ac.uk/)
**Bachelor's Degree, Computer Information Systems** - *2007 - 2009*

Final dissertation on: Applying User-Centered Design Techniques to Online Identity Systems:

> Based on best practices in the fields of Digital Identity, Interaction Design and Secure Usability, this project derives a series of principles for the design of User-centric Online Identity and Authentication platforms. These principles are: Secure by default; Trustworthy Interface; Control; Context; Visibility; Clarity; and Feedback. 
> Two key archetypes, identified during the practical component of this project, informed the creation of specific User Personas. Through these Personas it became apparent that factors such as the user's perception of control over their identify are essential to the success of Online Identity and Authentication systems.
